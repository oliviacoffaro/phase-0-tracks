1. What are classes? Be sure to define the following terms in your explanation and describe the relationships between them:

class - an object, there are built in classes, but you can also create your own
state - think of these also as attributes - state can be a characteristic or or data point of a instance within a class, each instance can have it's own attributes
behavior - this is another way to say method, function or procedure
instance variable - this is a variable avaiable across the method or object
instance method - instance method is a method that that can run on an instance

2. What are attributes?
  Instance variables

3. Give an example of a real world object, and describe how you might assign its attributes if you were to design a class to represent that object.

4. What is the purpose of the initialize method? When does it run?
  Runs when a new class is created, this is also a way to store variables

5. What are modules?
  modules are a set of methods that can be used on several different classes

6. What are the different ways you can use a module?
  you can assign to multiple classes - some are prexisting within ruby language, they also help with naming
