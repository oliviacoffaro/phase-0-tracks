3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
  Iteration or repition, looping is useful when you need a program to complete mulitple times 

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
