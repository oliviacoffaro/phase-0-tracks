Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
  Data structures are very important because they store information and values in a variable.  This helps us manipulate data more efficiently.

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
  An array is a data structure, you can list data in it and the data is indexed

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
  list of students names
  medicines you are taking

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
  hash is a data structure that contains key value pairs

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
  name: (food order)
  date: key event

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
  Iteration or repition, looping is useful when you need a program to complete mulitple times 

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
  Signing in at a doctors office, for instance, you need to collect the same set of data from several people.


Blocks
8. What is a block?
  A bulk amount of code between braces or between do and end

9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
  a block parameter comes from outside of the block, global instead of local value
