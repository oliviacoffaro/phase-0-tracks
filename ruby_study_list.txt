Classes, data structures, and iteration are the skills students struggle with the most -- make sure you're solid on using all three of those. But here's the full list of what counts as fair game on the assessment:

Data types, like boolean and string
  boolean - true false
  float - 12.343
  string - "this is a string"
  integer - 5 AKA Fixnum
Conditional statements, including complex ones that use && and ||
Creating, modifying, and iterating through hashes and arrays
Printing information and gathering information from the user
  gets.chomp
Control flow, like if/else, while, and so on
Declaring methods with or without parameters
Interpreting method signatures in documentation
  ???
The gotchas of implicit return
  ???
Classes, including attributes, instance methods, attr_reader, and attr_accessor
Reading and writing simple RSpec tests
