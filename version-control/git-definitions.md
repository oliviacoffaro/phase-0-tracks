# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
version control is the ability to make different features or changes and have multiple copies.  This is super useful when working with others, or when working on a new feature that you are unsure of how it might effect the master or other parts of the master
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is what is sounds like, breaking off from the master, creating a differernt version
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is saving your work into your repository, when making a commit message, you should clearly state the changes that are made in that commit so it's easy to go back later and know what version each commit is
* What is a merge conflict?
when there are conflicting edits
